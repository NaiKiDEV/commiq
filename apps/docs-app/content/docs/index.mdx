# Introduction

**Commiq** is a lightweight, command & event driven state management library for TypeScript. The core library has no framework dependencies — React bindings are available separately via `@naikidev/commiq-react`.

Instead of directly mutating state, you describe _what should happen_ via **commands**, and the store's handlers decide _how_ the state changes. Handlers can emit **events** to notify other parts of your application — enabling clean, decoupled architectures.

## Key Concepts

| Concept          | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Command**      | A request to do something — dispatched via `queue()`          |
| **Handler**      | A function that processes a command and updates state         |
| **Event**        | A notification that something happened — emitted by handlers  |
| **Store**        | Holds state, routes commands to handlers, broadcasts events   |
| **Sealed Store** | A read-only proxy exposing only `state`, `queue`, and streams |
| **Event Bus**    | Routes events between multiple stores                         |

## Packages

- **`@naikidev/commiq`** — Core library (framework-agnostic)
- **`@naikidev/commiq-react`** — React bindings (`useSelector`, `useQueue`, `useEvent`, `CommiqProvider`)
- **`@naikidev/commiq-devtools-core`** — Instrumentation, event timeline, and causality tracking
- **`@naikidev/commiq-devtools`** — Embedded devtools panel for React applications
- **`@naikidev/commiq-otel`** — OpenTelemetry tracing integration

## Quick Example

```ts
import { createStore, createCommand, sealStore } from "@naikidev/commiq";

const store = createStore({ count: 0 });

store.addCommandHandler("increment", (ctx) => {
  ctx.setState({ count: ctx.state.count + 1 });
});

const sealed = sealStore(store);
sealed.queue(createCommand("increment", undefined));
```
